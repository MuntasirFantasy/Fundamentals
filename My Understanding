So far, I have been studying! And my understadning is like below:

1. Artificial Intelligence: 
    Artificial Intelligence is a technique that make machine look intelligent. Intelligence is something that is hard to define.
So, it is said that if a machine can achieve something like human than it is an intelligent machine.

2. Machine Learning:
    Machine Learning is a method to teach meachine about data. Machine is provided a lot of data and the relationships among the data
is tried to be found in machine learning. It is done via mathematics and statistics. Which is called model. In programming, a function
is given and data are fed to machine to follow that function. But in machine learning data is fed to machine to generate the function,
that will fulfill the demand.
